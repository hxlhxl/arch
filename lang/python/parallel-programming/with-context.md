All of the objects provided by this module that have acquire() and release() methods can be used as context managers for a with statement. **The acquire() method will be called when the block is entered, and release() will be called when the block is exited.** Hence, the following snippet:

```
with some_lock:
    # do something...
```

is equivalent to:

```
some_lock.acquire()
try:
    # do something...
finally:
    some_lock.release()
```

Currently, Lock, RLock, Condition, Semaphore, and BoundedSemaphore objects may be used as with statement context managers.
